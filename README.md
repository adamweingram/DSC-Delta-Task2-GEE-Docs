## Key Features

- Employs [Google Earth Engine's](https://earthengine.google.com/) JavaScript API
- Focused on [Sentinel-2 data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_SR) from Earth Engine's extensive catalog
- Allows researchers to export time series tables for further analysis outside of the App

## How to Use

There are some steps that are important 

1. First, navigate to the Earth Engine scripting interface by visiting [https://code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) in your web browser.
    - *Make sure to sign in using your Google Earth Engine-enabled account!*
2. Find the `users/eorsgee/DSC-Delta-Task2` repository in the 'Scripts' tab. Open the `Task2` script.
    ![Step 2](media/Step2-FindRepository.png)
3. Verify that the `prefs` object at line `23` of the script contains the correct values for your needs. If the object contains suitable values, it does not need to be changed. An example of a `prefs` object can be seen below:
    ```javascript
    var prefs = {
        "tile": '10SFH',            // The Sentinel-2 Tile to focus on
        "ccLimit": 20,              // Ignore; this can be set in the UI
        "index_nir": "B8",          // The Sentinel-2 band to be considered Near-Infrared (NIR)
        "index_red": "B4",          // The Sentinel-2 band to be considered Red
        "index_green": "B3",        // The Sentinel-2 band to be considered Green
        "index_blue": "B2",         // The Sentinel-2 band to be considered Blue
        "preview_red": "TCI_R",     // Preview imagery red band
        "preview_green": "TCI_G",   // Preview imagery green band
        "preview_blue": "TCI_B",    // Preview imagery blue band
        "l_correction_factor": 0.5, // Default "L correction factor" that the vegetation index algorithms will use
        "date_range": ee.DateRange(globalStart, globalEnd)  // Ignore; this can be set in the UI
    };
    ```

4. Click the "Run" button above the script text editor pane.
    ![Step 4](media/Step4-ClickRun.png)
5. Using the UI that appears on the right side of the map pane, specify **cloud cover**, the **date range**, and the **target restoraion site**.
    ![Step 5](media/Step5-GUISettings.png)
    - As dates and other parameters are changed using the UI, the preview imagery in the map pane will automatically be refreshed and updated.
    ![Step 5: TCI Preview](media/Step5-GUIImgPreview.png)
6. Click the "Run Processing" button.
    ![Step 6](media/Step6-RunButton.png)
7. A chart visualizing the requested analysis will appear in the "console" tab.
    - To export a table, click on the boxed arrow in the top right corner of the chart.
8. The map preview will show the results of the calculated indices.

9. Done!

## Warnings, Tips, and Workarounds
- Google Earth Engine aggressively rate-limits larger operations, especially those that involve running reduce operations using large vectors. To work around this issue, each restoration site analysis task should be run independently so as not to trigger the rate limiting.
